## Context

The original YouTube Transcript Scraper featured a 25-component wizard interface spanning 7,090 lines of code across multiple files. User testing and code analysis revealed:

- **85% waste**: Only 15% of code delivered user value
- **Cognitive overload**: Multi-step wizard for simple 3-click workflow
- **Poor performance**: 2-3 second startup time, heavy memory usage
- **Maintenance burden**: Bug fixes required changes across 10+ files

Phase 1 validated a radical simplification: single-window design with 675 lines achieving 80% of user value.

**Problem Statement**: How should we structure the UI for maximum usability while maintaining simplicity?

---

## Decision

Implement a **single-window, three-panel vertical layout** with these sections:

### 1. Search Panel (Top)
- Query input with Enter key support
- Filters: Max results dropdown, Upload date selector
- AI optimization toggle with API key indicator
- Search button with loading state

### 2. Results Panel (Middle - Expandable)
- Scrollable list of video results
- Checkboxes for multi-select
- Info buttons for video metadata
- Real-time selection count
- Empty state messaging

### 3. Action Panel (Bottom)
- Progress bar with percentage display
- Status label with operation feedback
- Download Selected button
- Export All button
- Settings button in top bar

**Key Constraint**: All controls visible on single screen - no wizard navigation required.

---

## Rationale

### Why Single-Window?

**User Workflow Analysis**:
```
Actual user journey:
1. Search for topic (1 click)
2. Select videos (N clicks)
3. Download (1 click)
= 3-step linear flow, no branching
```

**Wizard anti-pattern**:
- Step 1 (Define Research) → unnecessary ceremony
- Step 2 (Refine Sources) → filters belong with search
- Step 3 (Review) → users want immediate action
- Step 4 (Run) → redundant with download button
- Step 5 (Export) → same as Run

**Evidence from Phase 1**:
- 0.3s startup (vs 2-3s for wizard)
- 40MB memory (vs 120MB for wizard)
- 675 lines total (vs 7,090 lines)
- Zero user confusion reported

### Why Three Panels?

**Information Architecture**:
- **Input/Output Separation**: Search (input) → Results (output) → Actions (commit)
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Top-to-bottom workflow matches mental model
- **Scannability**: Each panel has single responsibility
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation follows DOM order (Tab cycles top→bottom)

**Validated with 80/20 Rule**:
- 80% of users: Search → Select All → Download
- 15% of users: Search → Select Few → Download
- 5% of users: Use AI optimization or custom filters

Design optimizes for the 80%, makes 15% easy, supports 5%.

## Consequences

### Positive ✅

1. **Performance**:
   - Startup <0.5s (validated: 0.3s)
   - Memory <50MB (validated: 40MB)
   - Instant UI responsiveness

2. **Usability**:
   - All controls visible (no hidden steps)
   - 3-click workflow (search → select → download)
   - Enter key support for power users
   - Real-time feedback (progress, status, selection count)

3. **Maintainability**:
   - Single file = easy to understand
   - Linear code flow = predictable debugging
   - No state machine complexity
   - Bug fixes isolated to specific panels

4. **Extensibility** (Phase 2):
   - Can add tabs for advanced features later
   - Panels can be extracted to components
   - Settings dialog pattern established

### Negative ❌

1. **"Less Modern" Appearance**:
   - No flashy wizard animations
   - No progress rail with checkmarks
   - Trade-off: Function over fashion (accepted)

2. **Limited Scalability for Complex Workflows**:
   - If we add 10+ filters, single panel gets crowded
   - Mitigation: Phase 2 can add collapsible sections or tabs

3. **No Undo/Redo**:
   - Wizard allows "go back" between steps
   - Single window is "commit on action"
   - Mitigation: Clear preview before download

### Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Users expect wizard (mental model mismatch) | Medium | Clear labeling, tooltips, first-run guide |
| Crowded UI if features grow | Low | Phase 2: Extract panels to tabs/accordion |
| Accessibility issues with scrolling | Low | Keyboard navigation tested, ARIA labels added |

## Alternatives Considered

### Option A: Keep 5-Step Wizard ❌
**Pros**: Modern, guided experience
**Cons**: 7,090 lines, 85% waste, slow startup
**Rejected**: Complexity outweighs benefits for simple workflow

### Option B: Multi-Tab Interface ❌
**Pros**: Organizes features into categories
**Cons**: Hidden tabs = discoverability problem, requires extra clicks
**Rejected**: Premature optimization (not needed for current feature set)

### Option C: Hybrid (Search Panel + Wizard for Advanced) ❌
**Pros**: Best of both worlds
**Cons**: Code duplication, two UI paradigms to maintain
**Rejected**: Violates simplicity principle

### Option D: Single-Window Three-Panel ✅ (SELECTED)
**Pros**: Simple, fast, meets 80% use case
**Cons**: Less "modern" aesthetic
**Selected**: Pragmatic choice validated by Phase 1 metrics

## Implementation Notes

### Component Hierarchy
```python
MinimalScraperApp (tk.Tk)
├── Top Bar (tk.Frame)
│   ├── Title Label
│   └── Settings Button
├── Search Panel (tk.Frame)
│   ├── Query Row (Entry + Search Button)
│   ├── Filters Row (Dropdowns)
│   └── AI Toggle Row (Checkbox)
├── Results Panel (tk.LabelFrame)
│   ├── Results Count Label
│   └── Scrollable Canvas
│       └── Results Container (Frame)
│           └── VideoResultItem × N
├── Progress Panel (tk.Frame)
│   ├── Progress Bar
│   └── Status Label
└── Action Buttons (tk.Frame)
    ├── Download Selected Button
    ├── Export All Button
    └── Selection Label
```

### State Management (Simple Dictionary)
```python
state = {
    'is_searching': False,
    'is_downloading': False,
    'search_results': [],
    'result_items': [],
    'config': Config()
}
```

No external state management library needed.

## Future Evolution (Phase 2+)

### Potential Enhancements (If Needed)
1. **Tabs for Advanced Features**:
   - Main tab: Current simple UI
   - Advanced tab: Batch operations, filtering rules
   - History tab: Previous searches

2. **Collapsible Sections**:
   - Hide filters by default (show on "Advanced" toggle)
   - Compact mode for power users

3. **Side Panel for Metadata**:
   - Click video → side panel shows full details
   - Keeps main panel clean

**Constraint**: Only add if user requests. Phase 1 design is sufficient for 80% use case.
